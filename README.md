- ## Introduction

The Image to Various Sketch Converter is a data science project that leverages computer vision and deep learning techniques to transform images into a variety of sketch styles. This project utilizes Python, popular libraries like TensorFlow, OpenCV, and NumPy, and a pre-trained model for generating sketches.

## Features

- Convert color images to a variety of sketch styles.
- Support for multiple sketch filters and techniques.
- Adjustable parameters for fine-tuning sketch results.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface (CLI).
- Export sketch images in various formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.).
- Scalable and extendable for custom sketch styles.
## Filters
-The project supports a range of sketch filters and techniques, including but not limited to:

-Pencil Sketch
-blue Sketch
-cartoon Sketch
-Inverted Sketch
-Grayscale sketch
-Blur Sketch
